						Thank you. It's an honor to be here.
						So 5 years ago, I got a phone call from my mother.  She said
						to me something that I would never forget.

						Ramon, when are you going to find yourself a real job??

						That really caught me off guard, you know, I had been working really hard for a couple months on a startup idea. I said to my mother, once we get this round of founding or once we get
						a thousand users everything will be different.
						Does this sound familiar?? Anyway, she didn't understand. After this phone call, I  doubted my idea and I even took a full time job. Two months later, I decided to quit that job and work on my startup again. I realised and reassured myself that the only real job for me would be one where I follow my passion and I can do things that challenge me every day.

						So the next few minutes I am going try to give you some pointers about
						what is like to be a developer in different kinds of startups and maybe offer some insights
						from mistakes like this that I made on the way.

						</q>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Months before that phone call I graduated fresh from college in Chicago. At that
						time, as I told you I was tinkering with startups with some friends. And then, I had this really unique and original idea.
						Let's build a startup, change the world and get rich. Yeah, I know, at that time I was probably watching the social network way too many times.

					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						After finding a team, we started working and the first thing we noticed was really strange. We felt this huge external pressure that was like a heavy rock over our shoulders everyday.
						Society and media in particular have this established path of getting a degree, finding a "real" corporate job as they call it, getting a house and a dog, they rearely talk about startups and when they do it's just the huge success cases like the social networks so most people have a non realistic view of the startup world. It is really important to understand and be ready for this. Most of your friends and even your family are never going to understand what you are doing and the ones that do expect you to succeed like in the movie. For developers like us, its even  worse, they are going to ask you every week, How much money is your company making? You answer, where we are building the prototype and learning from our users. Oh why don't you work for this big company, you could be making so much money. 
						So, just try to abstract yourself from all this and focus on just moving this huge rock a little bit every day, creating a bit of value.

						2010-2012 / Early Stage / Raised +$125K / 5 people.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						After working really hard for several months. We released Netgamix. Netgamix was a platform where everyone could create trivia games about their
						favorite topics and share them with their friends. Summarizing quickly, we got
						admitted into startup bootcamp, we obtained seed investment, 
						got 20K  daily active users and more than 30K games were being played every day. So how did we get there and what do you need to succeed at an early stage startup?

					<h2>
						You only need one thing...
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Luckily, as a developer you only neeed one thing to start a company. Passion. 
				</section>
				<section>
					<image class="fragment roll-in" width='800'

					<aside class="notes">
						From my point fo view, there is only one reason to join a startup?? And no, it's not stock or money or the cool tech they are using. In my case, I grew up watching movies with my brother and were constantly asking each other questions to find out who knew the most. So, I built a platform where I could beat my brother and prove it to im and his friends. And I was passionate enough about it to build it. So really, the only reason to start or join at early stage is if you just can't help yourself. There is something driving you that you can't stop. 
				</section>
			  <section>
					<h2>
						Focus on just one thing...
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						This takes me to my next point. What should you focus that passion on at early stage? 
						Again, astonishingly simple. Just get things done. This is easier said than done. Specially for us, engineers.
						We tend to always try to find the perfect way to design this system or the most efficient implementation of this algorithm.
						I have a confession to make, the most valuable lesson I got from Netgamix was to stop being an engineer. Stop being and engineer and stop trying to preoptimize things. I have seen way too many times good engineers get caught in building perfect code and get caught in the details. What they are not realising that the tech
						is not the end goal, is just a means to an end, creating value.
						You are there to create value for your customer!!

					<aside class="notes">
						"Walking on water and developing software from requirements are both easy if both are frozen."
						Startups are the opposite of having clear requirements. As Eric Ries likes to say, they are created under extreme uncertainty. So the only way to find out where the value is and what the customers want is to get things done quicker and get them as fast as you can to the public so you can learn from them. You can spend 6 months in your garage writing perfect code and then you try to get it out and you may find out that nobody needs it. The code is perfect though. Maybe that's the reason why. Run away as fast as you can from perfect code.

						Measure, measure, measure...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						How to know if you are on the right track while you are gettings things done like crazy? Let me give you a couple recommendations as a developer. It is really important have a good tracking and AB test framework that indicate you how the things you are doing affect the business. Every time you iterate, every time you release a feature you ened to knowif you are moving the needle in the right direciton.

						During Netgamix, we spent time building a real time dashboard with ducksboard, optimizely and mixpanel. It really paid out, because we also used it as a real time reporting dashboard for our investors and board members.

						One of my biggest mistakes during Netgamix was not focusing 100% on getting to product market fit. Measuring what your customer does and also have an easy way to interact with them is key to shorten the feedback loop and get to product market fit.

					<aside class="notes">
						And knowing your users perfectly is key to be able to get what you need, revenue.
						To get there, in startups like in life closing is important. You are always selling yourself to a partner, investor, potential cofounder or employee so try to do it yourself or find someone that can.

					<h2>
						So what do I get?
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now, we have covered what things you need and things you do at early stage. Now, you may be wondering what can you expect to get from an early stage startup?
					</aside>

				<section>
					<image class="fragment roll-in" width='800' src='http://i.imgur.com/1sQKHId.gif'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Money? Not really, sorry. Besides, joining a startup for the salary would be a really obvious bad choice. As a founder you should
						always prioritize reinvesting money into the business than paying money for yourself. While I was in Netgamix, me and my cofounders we all agree to receive the same salary, just enough to cover our living expenses. This is pretty common and usually that is also a good sign for investors.

					<image class="fragment roll-in" width='500' src='http://prtipsforstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Startup-Equity-Dos-Equis-Guy.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Stock? Yes, you can get stock but always remember than 10% of nothing is still nothing. During Netgamix, me and my cofounders
						we all spent too much time about this topic and in the end it wasn't worth anything. So my recomendation, find people you respect and just split it evenly between the
						founders and close the topic.
						You have to create the value for the company, and that value comes from getting things done as we mentioned before.

						Startup Family
					</h2>
					<image class="fragment roll-in" width='800' src='http://i.imgur.com/HP5NItN.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						So what the hell can you get in an early stage startup then?
						A new Family! Yes, I am not kidding. You are practically marrying your cofounders. In fact, as Peter Thiel likes to put it, every startup should act a bit like a cult.
				  </aside>

					<h3> Lessons learned </h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Anyway, going back to my startup, 2 years into the startup our runaway was around 2 months and although our user base showed potential we couldn't monetize it well enough
						so we decided to move on. It is really important to realize your opportunity cost. Investors can invest in several startups at once but you can usually only found one startup at the same time if you want to sleep.

						Was Netgamix a success? It depends how you look at it. Did we exit? Hell no. But it was probably the job that made the biggest impact on my career and on my life.

						I made really good friends, met a lot of people, create a network and the most important part, have a lot of fun during the ride. Being in a startup with great people is an unique and amazing experience that is going to make you grow every day.

						2012-2014 / Post IPO / +2000 people
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Soon after we decided to close the office. Zynga called me and asked me if I wanted to consider a game developer position in Seattle. I loved games,web technology and startups and Zynga so it looked like the perfect place for me and my I just hit the jackpot.
						My mother of course was very happy about it as wll :)

						It was 2012. In those years, every one had a virtual farm. Oh, remember those glorius days where all your friends ask you to help plow your land or send you a chicken. Don'y you miss it? Probably not. 

						I worked during two years as an engineer building a match 3 game and also contributed to the first version of the advertisement platform.

						Those two years were really different from the life at Netgamix. Let me tell you a little bit about the main differences between working for an early stage startup and one that just IPOed.

						<h2>Scale</h2>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						As a developer, the most important thing to keep in mind in these kind of companies is the scale. Zynga at one point 
						had more than 50M daily active users. In these kind of companies, you really need to keep in mind that your code is going to be hammered really hard by a lot of concurrent users.

						<q>You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with</q>
						<p>- Jim Rohn</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						At these kind of companies, your peers are going to be likely really smart and knowledgeable. The reason is obvious, they just IPOed, they have money in the bank and their stock grants are actually worth something. Consequently, post IPO companies are usually very selective hiring.  That means you get to work with the best in your industry, so you can learn and hone your skills every day.

						Jim Rohn says that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
						

						In my case, I was honored to be able to work with extremely experienced people like the executive producer of Halo 3 or the creators of the matrix online.

						<h2>Culture & Perks</h2>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, there is a huge difference in culture. These companies would offer anything they can to attract top talent so besides a good salary and stock, they are famous for offering crazy perks like free lunches, alcohol, weekly parties, poker tournaments, massages. For example, Zynga even sent the top performing teams every quarter to Las Vegas or Hawaii.

						src='http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/work-hard-play-hard-but-don-t-mess-up-anything.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						You are expected to work hard and play hard but don't mess up anything.
						The downside of all these perks are that you are expected to get things done really fast and usually expected to work long hours as well. These companies usually have a higher churn because employees get burnt easily in these environments. During my time at Zynga, I actually worked under 5 different managers.

					<h3> Moving on...</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						After two crazy years at Zynga, the company decided to close the Seattle studio. 

						That gave me the perfect chance to move back to a smaller startup and take more ownership.

						2014-2015 / Pre-IPO, past Series B / 120 people.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						One year ago, I started working at Moz. Moz is the company leader in inbound online marketing, specially SEO. 
						Moz has raised almost $20M in two different rounds. Brad Feld, founder of TechStars is one of the members of the board.
						
						Pre IPO companies are usually like a middle ground between early stage and post IPO and they differ wildly.
				  </aside>

				<section>
					<image class="fragment roll-in" height='700'
						src='http://staciwallace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keep-calm-and-take-ownership-5.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						For me, the main difference is the amount of ownership. 
						These companies have fewer employees so you are going to be a big part of the company and you can receive much more responsabilities than the ones you get at a bigger company
						You sually get enough indepence and freedom to start new projects. I am currently starting a brand new product for Moz, so it feels like a startup within a startup.
						One important thing to highlight here is to invest in instrumentation if the company lacks of the correct infrastructure. In order to move fast, you need to be able to validate your assumptions. Sometimes, nobody would even know what they are, even better, a chance for you to tackle bigger projects and ownership.

					<q>Taking jobs that you don't like just to build up your resume is like saving up sex for old age</q>
					<p>Warren Buffet</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To wrap up, keep in mind that none of the paths guarantee success. Don't take a job just to build your resume. 
						As Warren Buffet said "taking jobs that you don't like just to build up your resume is like saving up sex for old age"

						Find the one thing you truly love and go for it, don't be afraid to escape what other think you may do, it doesn't matter if they are your friends, girlfriend or even your mother. Don't be afraid to follow your passion, don't be afraid to fail. Embrace it, step out of your comfort zone, grow your skills.

						That's what a real job is.
