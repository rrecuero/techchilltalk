						Thank you. It's an honor to be here.
						So 5 years ago, I got a phone call from my mother and she said
						to me something that I would never forget. She asked me:

						Ramon, when are you going to find yourself a real job??

						Wow, that hurt. You know, for the previous two months I had been working really hard on a startup idea. So, I said to my mother, once we get to 10 thousand users everything will be different or once we get a round of founding we will be rich!!!
						Does this sound familiar?? Anyway, she didn't understand. After this phone call, I questioned my idea and even wondered if doing a startup was the best thing for me at that moment. So I took a full time job as a developer.  Result: two months later, I was bored to death and I decided to quit that job. I realised and reassured myself that the only real job for me would be one where I follow my passion and I get new challenges every day.

						So the next few minutes I am going try to give you some pointers about
						what is like to be a developer in different stages of a startups from early stage to Post IPO and hopefully offer you some insights
						from  all the mistakes like this that I made on the way, that were many.

					<aside class="notes">
						Everything started a couple months before that phone call. I graduated fresh from college in Chicago. Me and my classmates, had this really unique and original idea!! Let's build a startup, change the world and get rich. Yeah, I know, we were probably watching the social network way too many times.

						After creating a team, we started working and the first thing we noticed was really strange. We felt this huge external pressure that was like a heavy rock over our shoulders.
						Its interesting, society and media in particular tend to promote this established path of going to college, getting a degree, getting an office job, getting a house and a dog. But they rarely talk about startups and when they do it's just about the huge success cases like twitter or facebook .So it's only natural than most people like my mother have a non non realistic view of what's a startup. It is really important that you understand and that you are aware of this pressure. Most of your friends and probably even your family are never going to understand what you are doing .Even the ones that do are going to ask you every time they see you, so you already got 10 thousand million of users or are you a millionaire already?. For developers like us, its even  worse. When I was working on my startup, one of my friends was working for a big company as a developer and he used to call me every three weeks. Every time the conversation would go like this? Ramon, so how much revenue are you getting? I replied something like well we are still working on the prototype, trying to build new features and learning from our users. Oh, that's such a shame, you could be making so much money if you work here with me. Thank you, that's really helpful. 
						It is really important that you abstract yourself and shield your team from this pressure and focus on just moving that huge rock a few inches every day, creating a bit of value at a time.

						2010-2012 / Early Stage / Raised +$125K / 5 people.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						After working really hard for several months, Netgamix was born. Netgamix was a platform where everyone could create trivia games about their favorite topics and share them with their friends. In short, our adventure lasted 2 years and , 
						admitted into an incubator, startup bootcamp, we obtained seed investment, 
						got 200K  monthly active users and we even made our first hire. In the end, we could not monetize it well enough. 
						I am going to try to give some advice about what do you need to succeed at early stage, what should you focus on and what we learned on the way.
				</section>
			  <section>
					<h2>
						You only need one thing...
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Luckily, as a developer you only neeed one thing to start a company. Passion. 
				</section>
				<section>
					<image width='800' 
						src='images/mark.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						From my point fo view, there is only one reason to join a startup?? And no, it's not stock or money or the cool tech they are using.
						The only reason to start or join at early stage is if you just can't help yourself. There is something driving you that you can't stop. In my case, I grew up watching movies with my brother and were constantly asking each other questions about Star Wars and LOTR and fighting to find out who knew the most. I was so passionate about beating my brother and proving it that I built a company around it. That's the kind of passion I am talking about.
				</section>
			  <section>
					<h2>
						Focus on just one thing...
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						This takes me to my next point. What should you focus that passion on at early stage? 
						Again, astonishingly simple. Just get things done. This is easier said than done. Specially for us, engineers.
						We tend to always try to find the perfect way to design this system or the most efficient implementation of this algorithm.
						Honestly, the most valuable lesson I got from Netgamix was to stop being an engineer. Stop being and engineer and stop trying to preoptimize things. I have seen way too many times good engineers, better than me,  get caught in building perfect code and get losst in the details. What they are not realising that the tech
						is not the end goal, is just a means to an end, creating value.
						You are there to create value for your customer!!
				</section>
				<section>
					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/uncertainty.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						"Walking on water and developing software from requirements are both easy if both are frozen."
						Startups are the opposite of having clear requirements. As Eric Ries likes to say, they are created under extreme uncertainty. So the only way to find out where the value is and what the customers want is to get things done quicker and get them as fast as you can to the public so you can learn from them. You can spend 6 months in your garage writing perfect code and then you try to get it out and you probably realize that nobody wants it. But The code is perfect. Maybe that's the reason why. Run away as fast as you can from perfect code.

					<image width='1000' 
						src='images/blind.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						How to know if you are on the right track while you are gettings things done like crazy? Let me give you a couple recommendations as a developer. It is really important that you invest early a good amount of time in a instrummentation and AB tasting framework to track your KPIs and experiment around new features with your users. Every time you iterate, every time you release a feature you need to know if you are moving the needle in the right direciton.

						During Netgamix, we spent time building a real time dashboard with technologies like ducksboard, optimizely and mixpanel. It really paid off and we even used it as a real time reporting dashboard for our investors and board members.

						One of my biggest mistakes during Netgamix was not focusing 100% on getting to product market fit. Knowing your customer an easy way to interact with them is key to shorten the feedback loop and get to product market fit.

				<section>
					<image width='1000' src='images/closing.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						The more you know your customer, the easier is going to be to sell to them.
						We, as developers, tend to underestimate this. We believe that if we build the perfect product, users are gping to come
						knocking at our doors. Unfortunately, that's not true. In startups like in life closing is important. I was guilty of this myself, I always preferred writing code than going events, conferences or pithcing. Luckily, I had mentors like Cristobal that pushed me to step out of my comfort zone. If it doesn't come natural to you, take it as an opportunity to grow and learn.

					<h2>
						So what do I get?
					</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now, we have covered what things you need and what should you focus on at early stage. Now, you may be wondering what can you expect to get from an early stage startup as a developer?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' src='images/jerry.gif'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Money? Not really, sorry. Besides, joining a startup for the salary would be a really obvious bad choice. As a founder you should
						always prioritize reinvesting money into the business than paying money for yourself. In fact, investors would see a huge red flag if you don't.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='500' src='images/equity.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Stock? Yes, but they are not much more than lottery numbers at this point. Remember that 10% or 20% of nothing is still nothing. During Netgamix, me and my cofounders
						we all spent too much time worrying about this topic and trying to find the perfect split and in the end it wasn't worth anything. So my recomendation, find people you respect, split it evenly between the
						founders and close the topic.
						You have to create the value for the company, and that value comes from getting things done as we mentioned before.

					<h2>
						Startup Family
					</h2>
					<image width='800' src='images/family.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						So what the hell can you get in an early stage startup then?
						A new Family! Yes, I am not kidding. You are practically marrying your cofounders. You are going to spend more time with them than with your friends, father, mother or even your girlfriend or boyfriend.

						In a startup there is only you and your team. So your team needs to do everything from marketing to pitching, customer support, development or sales. If you are not going to do it, nobody else is going to do it. You are the last line of defence. Being in the trenches every day working together and trying to move this huge rock, creates a huge feeling of belonging and camaradery that is really difficult to replicate.

						Peter Thiel even says that every great startup should act a bit like a cult.
				  </aside>

				<section>
					<h3> Lessons learned </h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Anyway, going back to my startup, 2 years in our runaway was only around 2 months and although our user base showed potential we couldn't monetize it well enough so we decided to move on.

						Was Netgamix a success? It depends how you look at it. Did we exit? Hell no. But it was probably the job that made the biggest impact on our lives, both personally and profesionally.

						And the most important part, we had a lot of fun during the ride. It is easy to forget while you are working like crazy and worrying
						about funding but Being in a startup with great people is an unique and amazing experience that is going to make you grow every day.

						2012-2014 / Post IPO / +2000 people
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Soon after we decided to close the office, I got the opportunity to join Zynga in Seattle. I loved games,web technology and startups and Zynga just IPOed so it looked like the perfect place for me.
						Of course, my mother was really happy as well.

				<section>
					<image width='800'

					<aside class="notes">
						To give you a bit of context, it was 2012. In those years, every one had a virtual farm. Oh, remember those glorius days where all your friends ask you to help plow your land or send you a chicken. Don'y you miss it? Probably not. 

						I worked during two years as an engineer building a match 3 game and also building the first the advertisement platform for the company.

						Those two years were really different from the life at Netgamix. Let me tell you a little bit about the main differences between working for an early stage startup and one that just IPOed.
				  </aside>
				</section>

				  	<image width='800' 
							src='images/zynga.jpg'>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						As a developer, the most important thing to keep in mind in these kind of companies is the scale. Zynga at one point 
						had more than 50M daily active users. That means that your code is going to be hammered really hard by a lot of concurrent users so you really need to optimize your code to keep costs and response time low.
					 </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' 
							src='images/ateam.jpg'>
					<aside class="notes">
						Another difference is that in these companies you are going to get to work with the best in your industry. Why? The reason is simple. These companies have a lot of cash in the bank, their stock is actually worth something, that makes them really attractive so they are really picky hiring.

						Jim Rohn says that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

						In a company like this, that means you get to work with the best in your industry, 
						so you can learn from your peers and grow every day.

						In my case, I was honored to be able to work with extremely experienced people like creators of Halo 3, Everquest or Matrix online.

						<h2>Culture & Perks</h2>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, there is a huge difference in culture. These companies would offer anything they can to attract top talent so besides a good salary and stock, they are famous for offering crazy perks like free lunches, alcohol, weekly parties, poker tournaments, massages. For example, during my time at Zynga, one day 10 huge limos stopped outside of the office. We didn;t know waht was going on. Minutes later there was a company email asking who wanted to go to Vegas
						right away, all expenses paid. 

					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<image width='800' 
						src='images/workhard.png'>
					<aside class="notes">
						In these kind of environments, you are expected to work hard and play hard but don't mess up anything.
						The obvious downside of all these perks is that the company is trying to keep you in the office as long as they can and they usually succeed.
						So it becomes the standard, and you are expected to work long hours. That leads to higher churn because employees get burnt faster. During my time at Zynga, I actually worked under 6 different managers in less than 2 years.

						2014-2015 / Pre-IPO, past Series B / 120 people.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						After two crazy years at Zynga, I even starting to feel the burnt and the company decided to start closing remote studios so

						That gave me the perfect chance to move back to a smaller startup and take more ownership.
						One year ago, I joined Moz. Moz is the marketing leader in SEO. 
						Moz has raised almost $20M in two different rounds and we are about 140 people right now.
						
						Pre IPO companies are usually like a middle ground between early stage and post IPO and they differ wildly.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<image height='700'
						src='images/calm.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						For me, the main difference is the amount of ownership. These companies are still small enough that there is enough uncertainty, so you can take on new challenges and claim ownership. And at the same time, they are big enough that
						there is enough stability so you do not need to worry about your salary or the short term life of the company.

						For me,  Moz represents the perfect mix between Netgamix and Zynga. I was even given the opportunity to start a brand
						new product from scratch with a couple coworkers. It actually feels a lot like doing a startup with a safety net, a startup withing a bigger startup. You are creating value from scratch but you have all the resources of the parent company at your fingertips, so you can just focus on gettings things done.

					<q>Taking jobs that you don't like just to build up your resume is like saving up sex for old age</q>
					<p>Warren Buffet</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To wrap up, keep in mind that none of the paths guarantee success. There is o magic recipe. 
						Don't take a job just to build your resume. As Warren Buffet said "taking jobs that you don't like just to build up your resume is like saving up sex for old age"

						Find the one thing you truly love and go for it, don't be afraid to escape what other think you may do, it doesn't matter if they are your friends, girlfriend or even your mother. Don't be afraid to follow your passion, don't be afraid to fail. Embrace it, step out of your comfort zone, grow.

						That's what a real job is. Thank you very much!
